1. A description of the project: 
    - What it does:
        - Hangman is a game wherein the CPU will choose a predetermined word for the PLAYER to guess.
        - The player gets 7 chances to guess a correct letter in the word. One each for the gallow post, noose, head and body. Two each for the legs and arms.
        - If the player guesses the word before all chances are expended, the man to be hanged is saved.
        - If the player runs out of chances to get the right letters, the man gets hanged.
    - The aim of the project:
        - The aim of this project is to familiarise myself with classes, methods and atributes off those classes, functions and modules. Also to gain more experience working with git, github, branches and merging as well as other version control benefits.
    - What you learned:
        - So far I have learned:
            - Python is a much higher level language than I was aware of. My first attempt at this game was structured as C++ with pythonic syntax to a PEP8 standard for the most part.
